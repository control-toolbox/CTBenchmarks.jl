# Control-toolbox benchmarks

## Description

This project is a tool to compare the performance of [`OptimalControl`](https://github.com/control-toolbox/OptimalControl.jl) and other existing tools such as `JuMP` and `InfiniteOpt` in solving optimal control problems from the package [`OptimalControlProblems.jl`](https://github.com/control-toolbox/OptimalControlProblems.jl).
The goal is to evaluate the performance of `OptimalControl` in terms of speed and accuracy. It also aims to identify the limitations of OptimalControl and to propose some improvements.

## Getting Started

For this project, you need to have the following packages installed:
1. Models
    - [OptimalControlProblems](https://github.com/control-toolbox/OptimalControlProblems.jl)
    - [JuMP](https://jump.dev/JuMP.jl/stable/) 
    - [OptimalControl](https://control-toolbox.org/OptimalControl.jl/stable/)
    - [ExaModels](https://exanauts.github.io/ExaModels.jl/stable/)
    - [NLPModels](https://jso.dev/NLPModels.jl/stable/)
2. Solvers
    - [IPOPT](https://github.com/jump-dev/Ipopt.jl)
    - [KNITRO](https://www.artelys.com/app/docs/knitro/1_introduction.html): To use KNITRO, you need a license from [Artelys KNITRO](https://www.artelys.com/products/knitro/). For installation instructions, you can check the [installation guide](https://www.artelys.com/app/docs/knitro/1_introduction/installation.html).
    - [HSL_jll](https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/libhsl): After obtaining the license, to use the HSL solvers in Julia, you can check the following [link](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/how-to-get-hsl-up-and-running-with-ipopt/114138/3) for installation instructions.
    - [MadNLP](https://madnlp.github.io/MadNLP.jl/stable/)

    - [MathOptSymbolicAD](https://juliapackages.com/p/mathoptsymbolicad)

## Important Note on Linear Solvers

Some tests use the MA57 linear solver, which is often more efficient than the default MUMPS solver. However, MA57 requires a (free) license from HSL.

By default, all lines enabling MA57 are commented out in the test scripts. If you wish to use MA57:

1. **Obtain a license** for HSL from [STFC](https://licences.stfc.ac.uk/product/libhsl).
2. **Follow the installation instructions** to set up HSL with Julia. See [this guide](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/how-to-get-hsl-up-and-running-with-ipopt/114138/3) for details.
3. **Uncomment the relevant lines** in the code to enable MA57. 
    ```julia
    # Optionally, set the path to the HSL library if needed:
    # set_attribute(DuctedFanJMP, "hsllib", HSL_jll.libhsl_path)
    ```
    and
    ```julia
    #linear_solver="ma57",
    #hsllib=HSL_jll.libhsl_path,
    ```

If you do not have a license, the tests will run with the default MUMPS solver.

## Benchmark

The directory `benchmark` contains the benchmark of the different problems from `OptimalControlProblems`.  
The main three files are :
- ***"GoddardModels"*** : This file contains the benchmark of the Goddard Rocket Problem using different linear solvers (MUMPS, HSL_MA57 and HSL_MA27) with both JuMP and OptimalControl. We compare the results on terms of speed and accuracy.
- ***"GoddardJuMPs"*** : This file contains the benchmark of the Goddard Rocket Problem using JuMP. We compare the results of different linear solvers, backends, and nonlinear solvers. The goal is to find the best combination that gives the best results.
For this matter, we use the following functions that varyate the different parameters:
    - *"backend_variant"* : This function compares the results of different backends (ExaModels, JuMPDefault and SymbolicAD) with JuMP.
    - *"linear_solver_variant"* : This function compares the results of different linear solvers (MUMPS, HSL_MA57 and HSL_MA27) with JuMP.
    - *"solver_variant"* : This function compares the results of different nonlinear solvers (IPOPT, MadNLP and KNITRO) with JuMP.
- ***"Benchmark"*** : This file contains the benchmark module that solves the different models with different solvers and compares the results in terms of speed and accuracy.
  It contains 5 main functions:
    - *"Benchmark_model(model_key,nb_discr_list)"* : This function compares the results of different solvers (JuMP and OptimalControl) on a specific problem (model_key) with different discretization values (nb_discr_list).
    - *"Benchmark_JuMP(nb_discr_list,excluded_models)"* : This function compares the results of solving with JuMP on the different problems with different discretization values (nb_discr_list). It excludes the problems in the excluded_models list.
    - *"Benchmark_OC(nb_discr_list,excluded_models)"* : This function compares the results of solving with OptimalControl on the different problems with different discretization values (nb_discr_list). It excludes the problems in the excluded_models list.
    - *"Benchmark_Callbacks(model_key,nb_discr_list)"* : This function compares the results of different callbacks on a specific problem (model_key) with different discretization values (nb_discr_list).
    - *"Benchmark_KNITRO(model_key,nb_discr_list)"* : This function compares the results with KNITRO on a specific problem (model_key) with different discretization values (nb_discr_list).
      
    To run the benchmark, you can use the following command:
```julia
    include("./path/to/Benchmark.jl")
    Benchmark.Benchmark_OC()
    Benchmark.Benchmark_JuMP()
    Benchmark.Benchmark_model(:glider)
```

The results of the benchmark are generated in the `benchmark/outputs` directory. They are saved in Latex files that contains the following columns:

- *Model* : The name of the problem.
- *Discretization* : The number of discretization points.
- *Iterations* : The number of iterations.
- *Total Time* : The total time taken to solve the problem.
- *Ipopt Time* : The time taken by Ipopt to solve the problem.
- *Objective Value* : The value of the objective function.
- *Flag* : The status of the solution.
